#### 1. Lab Research
&emsp;&emsp;We develop several methods including inorganic synthesis, cluster and nanochemistry, synthesis of functional molecules/materials, colloid and interface chemistry, inorganic functional material chemistry, composite and hybrid material chemistry, surface chemistry, structure and reaction mechanism, energy material chemistry, etc. The main research direction is composite nano-synthesis and mechanism, and various extended applications. Committed to expanding new methods, synthesizing new nanostructures, studying their formation mechanism, developing new synthesis methods for amorphous surface control, and making nanosynthesis shift from traditional fields to multi-component, composite structures, assembled structures, new lattices, and low symmetry And the synthesis of new directions such as chiral structure.

#### 2. PI
&emsp;&emsp; <a href="https://nanosynthesis.github.io/chy.html">Prof. Hongyu Chen</a>

&emsp;&emsp;Committed to advancing the control of nanosynthesis, developing new synthesis methods (similar to organic reactions), discovering the mechanism behind them, and applying these tools to expand novel nanostructures and explore new applications. The synthetic methods of its development include:
1) Through the construction of solid-solid interface, continuously control the core-shell, eccentric, Janus and other nanostructures;
2) The solution operation method of nanowires, such as spiraling into circles, twisting into twists, weaving into ropes, etc.;
3) Construction of chiral nanostructures;
4) Site-selective multi-step nanosynthesis;
5) New manipulation methods, such as stretching through macroscopic carriers, bending caused by ultrasound, deformation induced by external magnetic field, etc.
A total of more than 170 papers have been published, including more than 70 articles published in high-impact journals (IF>10) as corresponding authors. Presided over 1 general and major cultivation project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China, 14 scientific research projects in Singapore, and 1 major project of the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province. Among the doctors and post-doctors trained by it, 17 have become professors/associate professors/assistant professors at home and abroad.
